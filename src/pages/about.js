      <h2>I'm Chris Scouras and this is my portfolio site.</h2>
      <p>
        I am teaching myself how to code utilizing resources online such as
        <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> FreeCodeCamp </a>
        to achieve my goal of becoming a full stack JavaScript developer.
      </p>
      <p>I have received my
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/cscouras/front-end-certification" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" > Front End Development certificate </a> from FreeCodeCamp and am currently working through
        the Data Visualization section of the curriculum. I will continue to update
        the <Link to="/projects">projects section </Link> of this site as I complete projects and earn certifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the course of my self-directed study and completion of projects in the FreeCodeCamp
        curriculum I have learned about and used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript as well
        as libraries and technologies such as Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery,
        React, and Sass. In building my React applications I've set up my development environment
        with Webpack and manually configured Sass and Babel loaders, though I've learned that create-react-app
        can be a wonderful tool when I just want to get started. I do my best to keep up with the always changing
        web development landscape. Recently I've been looking into CSS Grid and how I can implement it when considering
        layout for my projects. I am familiar with version control software, I have used Mercurial in the past
        and am using git and GitHub to manage my current projects.
